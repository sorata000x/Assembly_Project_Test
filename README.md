# Assembly_Project_Test
Program to test assembly projects in c++

**Implemented**
 - Call a .asm function from .cpp

**Working On**
 - Call .asm function from another .asm file

**Future**


**Issue**
 - Calling .asm file including Irvine32.inc library results error:
 ```
 main.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _test1 referenced in function _main
  Hint on symbols that are defined and could potentially match:
    _test1@4
```
